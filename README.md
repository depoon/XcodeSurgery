# XcodeSurgery

XcodeSurgery is a swift XCode build phase CLI tool for copying compiled binaries between iOS app targets. 

## The downside with using `xcconfig` or `preprocessor macros` to manage build variants
Building different build variants using configuration will trigger recompilation as the build processes do not share common `$(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)`. Changing preprocessor macro values will trigger dependency graph reanalysis and recompilation of codes. Ideally there should not be recompilation if there's no change in the logic of the source codes.

## Solution: Create a placeholder target and swap binaries.
XcodeSurgery aims to eliminate unnecessary recompilation of source codes when building different flavours or variants of an iOS app target.

## Installing XCodeSurgery


XcodeSurgery is available through Mint ðŸŒ±.
```sh
mint install depoon/XcodeSurgery
```

Mint can be installed via Homebrew
```sh
brew install mint
```

## 4 Simple Steps to Setup XcodeSurgery in your Project
1. Create a new app target. We will refer this as the `Destination Target` and the original target as the `Source Target`

2. Copy Build Settings of `Source Target` over to `Destination Target`.

3. Add Preparation Build Phase for `Source Target` using the following command
```sh
xcodesurgery prepare \
--workingDirectory "<WorkingDirectory>" \
--targetBuildDirectory ${TARGET_BUILD_DIR} \
--targetName "${TARGETNAME}"
```
4. Add Transplant Build Phase for `Destination Target` using the following command
```sh
xcodesurgery transplant \
--action ${ACTION} \
--targetBuildDirectory ${TARGET_BUILD_DIR} \
--workingDirectory "<WorkingDirectory>" \
--sourceTarget "<SourceTargetName>" \
--destinationTarget ${TARGETNAME} \
--sdkName ${SDK_NAME}

```

## To build the variants
1. Build the `Source Target`

2. Build the `Destination Target`

## Deploying the app variants
Run the `Destination Target` and observe that you can deploy a clone app of the `Source Target`

You can modify the `Destination Target` build settings with different bundle identifiers, code signing instructions and provisioning profiles to create different build variants.
